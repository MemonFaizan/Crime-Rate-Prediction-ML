# Crime Rate Prediction - Machine Learning Project

## About
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict crime rates based on historical data. It analyzes various factors and predicts crime hotspots using different models like Regression, Random Forest, etc.

## Files:
- **Code**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **PPT**: Presentation explaining the project and model.
- **Documentation**: Detailed report on the model's approach, dataset used, and results.
